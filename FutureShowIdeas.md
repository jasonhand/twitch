# Future Show Ideas

## Episodes

### Install and configure Jitsi on Azure

(Create meet.communitypulse.io)

### Add custom domain to URL shortener (for jhand.tv)

### Logic App that tweets on a schedule to share the shortlinks from the URL shortener .. including text ready from table storage

### Create landing page for jhand.tv/hi to redirect to (doesn't need a custom domain) - Probably use Hugo (and maybe Jamstack)

### Contributing to MileHighBluegrass.com

### Setup donation landing page for "Live" show (jhand.tv/donate)

### Creating all resources needed for [Episode 4](ep04/README.md) using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template



(Project ICYMI: Read the shortlinks from table storage, and tweet them on a schedule)

### Work on Mile High Bluegrass

### Work on [Oncall.life](https://oncall.life)
